# Elm 0.18 with Webpack 3, Hot Loading & Bootstrap 4

My Elm dev environment with hot-loading (i.e. state is retained as you edit your code, uses https://github.com/fluxxu/elm-hot-loader). Like elm-community/elm-webpack-starter but using Webpack 3. I Use this daily for professional work.

## Installation

With npm

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

With yarn
```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
 ```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start modifying the code in /src.

## Production

Build production assets with:

```sh
npm run prod
```
