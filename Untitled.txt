ill need a model at every point in the game.. obvi
didnt i map this out?? lets grab that

sittingDown
    satDown and waiting (teams established)
iNeedToDeal (big ol dealer button) (if dealer)
iHaveCards (5 4 3 2 1)
    myTurn
    notMyTurn
---- 
cardsOnTheTable (whatever card just played)
____    
satDown and waiting.
iNeedToDeal

okay, what about screw your neighbor?
that seems like a good intro
each player (unlimited) is given a card.
starting to the left of the dealer, you can hold or pass
if you pass, the next player in line switches with you
each player needs to hold the whole model


dealRandom is a side effect

scores: [] -- array length of players, each representing their score
dealt: [] -- array length of the players
playerIdx : Int -- index the current player sits in dealt array
dealerIdx : Int -- index of the dealer, as sitting in dealt
totalPlayer Int -- the total number of players, (maybe redundant)
